    <h2>Phoenix Pina</h2>
    <p>Hello everybody, my name is Phoenix Pina, and I am 23 years old. 
    This is my second semester as a full time BYUI student. Last year I attended BYUI on campus,
    but this year I need to take classes online for a few reasons. I am currently living in Yuba
    City, California (near Sacramento).</p>
    <p>I really like video games and anime. My favorite video games come from the Pokemon, Zelda, 
    and Megami Tensei series (that's the series with Persona in it), and my favorite anime is One Piece.
    My favorite band is Twenty One Pilots.</p>
    <p>I am majoring in computer science. Last year my major was chemistry, but I had no real interest 
    in chemistry as a career. I had no direction in life in terms of a possible career, and I was my high
    school's best chemistry student, and found the subject interesting. But after having to withdraw from
    BYUI's General Chemistry 2, I realized that I must do something I am passionate about. So I plan on using
    a computer science degree with the certificates that will come with it to go into the video game industry.
    (And if it doesn't work out, that's alright. Everyone needs IT people.) So I look forward to learning with all of you.</p>
