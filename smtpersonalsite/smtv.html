            <p>Shin Megami Tensei V (as in the roman numeral "5") is of the mainline series of Megami Tensei, released on 
                November 11, 2021 for the Nintendo Switch. You play as a schoolboy of modern day Tokyo who finds an entrance 
                to post-apocalyptic Tokyo, which has been overrun by demons. You fuse with a demon to become a Nahobino, which 
                is a being with the potential to rival a god. You learn how to fight and befriend and summon demons to help 
                you survive against hostile demons, and you and your schoolmates find yourselves in the crosshairs of 
                angels and demons in a war to claim God's throne.

            <h2>What Is Good</h2>
            <p>A number of fans have critical and negative views of this game, and some of these fans are reasonable, while 
                certain fans hate the game because they only like the older games and hate anything that's new. (What else is new?)
                I will discuss what I believe the game did well and... not well. Let's start with the good.</p>

            <img class="smtv-overworld" src="images/smtv-overworld.jpg" alt="SMTV Overworld">

            <p>The graphics are outstanding. People tend to make fun of the Nintendo Switch's graphics and ability to run 
                games, but this game looks great, both in battle and outside. Outside of battle, the game is semi-open world. 
                The Pokémon Sword and Shield DLC areas are a fair comparison in terms of how gameplay outside of battle works. 
                It's no Fallout game or Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but you have a lot to explore in post-apocalyptic Tokyo, 
                and for a destroyed, former shell of Tokyo, the overworld looks beautiful in my opinion. Another thing worth 
                mentioning is the soundtrack. Admittedly, other Megaten games have better overall soundtracks, but this game still 
                has a good soundtrack nonetheless. Some of the overworld tracks sound similar or repetitive, but a lot of the songs 
                and battle music are very good, pleasant to listen to, and can be found on Spotify. </p>

            <img class="smtv-combat" src="images/smtv-battle.jpg" alt="SMTV Combat">

            <p>In combat, not only does the game look good, but the combat is fun. In the Shin Megami Tensei games, there is something 
                called the "Press Turn" system. Basically, you have 1 action for each party member you have (your party consists of 
                you and up to 3 demons), and a side takes actions until they run out of actions, then it becomes the opponent's turn.
                However, you gain an action if you strike an enemy's weakness using an attack (like in Pokémon- demons can be weak to 
                fire and such), and you lose an action if an attack misses or the enemy nullifies the attack somehow ON TOP OF the action 
                you just technically lost. SMT V keeps this system, which is a challenging combat mechanic, especially for new players, 
                but this is fine since you can change the difficulty at any time (outside of battle, of course). This specific game 
                also adds a mechanic called Magatsuhi Skills. Magatsuhi is a type of demonic energy, and as you charge your Magatsuhi 
                gauge through battle and exploration, you and your demons gain access to a special attack that doesn't consume an action. 
                Overall, the combat feels balanced, especially with changeable difficulty.</p>
            
            <p>Another well done aspect is the demons. Demons are seen roaming the lands, and you enter battle by colliding with one. 
                This is a step up from past games, in which battles start randomly just from running around, or the demons roaming the 
                lands all looked like a generic shadowy or digital creature. You actually see the specific demons in this game. You are 
                able to carry around many demons at once, and similarly to how one can get attached to their Pokémon, you can get attached to 
                your demons, in which traditionally is advised against if your demons aren't endgame, high level demons since the main 
                way to get better demons is fusing your demons together to make a brand new mythological creature. Plus, demons usually stop 
                leveling up efficiently after a certain predetermined level. However, in this game there are items that permit you to level up 
                your demons easier, so if you have a demon you don't want to get rid of, you can continually strengthen it and keep it alongside you. 
                Some demons are non-hostile and can be spoken to in the overworld to give you side quests or general information, which I think 
                is pretty cool. Demon negotiation is also fun- learning how to respond to beings with different personalities is something 
                I find fun, and it is also easier in this game than past games, such as the meme'ed SMT IV, which had notoriously difficult 
                demon negotiations. (Shoutout SMT IV though- negotiations in that game taught me how to talk to customers in retail, 
                difficult and friendly alike.)</p>

            <h2>What Isn't So Good</h2>
            <p>Now I'll go over what I believe the game did poorly. For starters, the main story is boring. Story plot points are, 
                for the most part, dull and uninteresting. I won't go into spoilers, but there's your warning. Similar to Fallout 4 
                and Zelda: Breath of the Wild, gameplay is probably the aspect that will keep you playing the game, not the story. </p> 
            
            <p>Now here's something Fallout 4 and Breath of the Wild do well that SMT V doesn't. Making interesting characters. 
                Other Megaten games, like SMT IV and Persona 4, have human characters that are interesting, have development, and are 
                loveable. Demons aren't the only interesting characters, the humans are as well. But not in SMT V. You have a few schoolmates 
                that enter demonic Tokyo with you, which is usually standard issue in the mainline Shin Megami Tensei games- you usually 
                have human companions that may fight alongside you, and some will try to persuade you to act according to their moral beliefs 
                (lawfully, chaotically, or neutrally- if you don't actually know what these terms mean, I suggest looking them up. Law and chaos 
                may not mean what you think they mean.). You have companions like these in this game, but they don't do much outside of cutscenes. 
                There is one schoolmate who does become very useful (and at that point, likeable in my opinion) late in the game, but other 
                than that, your schoolmates are not interesting, don't help you, and barely influence your choice of alignment.</p> 

            <p>Speaking of alignment, usually the SMT games have different events or endings based on your choices and actions. But in this game, 
                while you do have some choices to make in cutscene dialogue and side quests, they do almost nothing, and in the end, the 
                ending of the game is decided based on a singular choice you make. One final complaint, the game is a Nintendo Switch exclusive. 
                In the past year, ATLUS has been pretty good with releasing games for all modern platforms, but before 2022, ATLUS kind of 
                released games on seemingly random modern platforms for some reason. Maybe there's a business decision behind it, but SMT V 
                should be available on PlayStation, Steam, and Xbox (at least on Xbox Game Pass).</p>

            <img class="smtv-contrast" src="images/smtv-contrast.png" alt="Cool SMT V Image">

            <p>Overall, I recommend Shin Megami Tensei V. It is a beautiful and fun game, even though the story is lacking.
                It is also a good entry game in the Megami Tensei franchise because it isn't as difficult as the older games. Also, 
                typically people are more willing to play a game with modern graphics. If they like the modern game, they'll be more willing 
                to go back and play the older games. Though, maybe you are someone who has a strong affinity towards older games, and wouldn't 
                mind starting with the famous Shin Megami Tensei III for PS2 or even the first Shin Megami Tensei for the SNES.
