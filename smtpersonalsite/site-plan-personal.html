      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is a website that informs people about a video game series called “Megami Tensei” by the company ATLUS (owned by SEGA). 
        It is popular it Japan, but was a niche series in the United States until the game “Persona 5” was released
        for western audiences in 2017. 
        People that enjoy video games, especially Japanese role playing games, would come to this site. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Questions that would be answered (on the home page) are: 
        What is the game series about? (Most of the games take place in post-apocalyptic Japan, where demons have taken over. 
        However, some games, notably the Persona series, take place in modern day Japan.) 
        What is the gameplay like? (Most of the games are turn-based, like Pokémon.) 
        How has the game series evolved over time? (The first game came out in 1987, so there’s a lot of evolving that has been done.)
        What exactly are demons in this game? (Demons are any type of supernatural entity that can interfere with human life 
        and can be summoned by something called the Demon Summoning Program. 
        Demons take the form of creatures and figures from nearly every mythology there is.) 
        Why are there so many series within this series? (There’s a lot of spinoff series. The main series is the “Shin Megami Tensei” series. 
        The most famous spinoff is “Persona”, and other notable spinoffs are “Digital Devil Saga”, “Devil Summoner”, and “Devil Survivor”.)
        Is the game appropriate for all ages? (Most of the games are rated M- but honestly, they are very tame for M rated games. 
        A 14 year old could be mature enough to play them.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Visitors of this website would want to come here as opposed to other sites because not only will I explain what the game series is, 
        I will give honest opinions of the 3 games I will cover and why people should play them. 
        If you were to go to the main ATLUS site, you aren’t given much about how the game is. If you go to other review sites, 
        some of the information may be misleading because many people only know Persona 5 and use that as their constant frame of reference, 
        while many others glorify the old games and immediately declare every new game of the series is bad.
        My website will have information and reviews for 3 modern games that are knowledgeable and point out both good and bad things 
        instead of focusing on just good or just bad.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Shin Megami Tensei V</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 will focus on Shin Megami Tensei V. Released for the Switch in 2021, it is part of the main series. 
        This will be divided into 2 sections: the good and the bad, as there are mixed reviews of this game. 
        It has good gameplay, graphics, soundtrack, and the demons are an enjoyable aspect, 
        while the story and human characters are poorly written.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Persona 5 Royal</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 will be focused on Persona 5 Royal, the expanded version of Persona 5. P5R released in the west in March 2020 for Playstation 
        and was released on all modern platforms in October 2022. This is the most famous game of the Megami Tensei series. 
        As such, this page will be describing why the game is so good while also explaining some of the weaker aspects of the game, 
        which are things people should know especially since more people are going to have interest in this game since it is 
        available on all modern gaming consoles now. 
        There will be 2 main sections- one dedicated to explain gameplay, and the second will review the 
        good and bad aspects of the story and character writing without spoiling the story.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Soul Hackers 2</h3>
      <p>
        I will also be adding a page 4. This one focuses on Soul Hackers 2, of the Devil Summoner series. 
        This one got attacked by the fanbase. It does have issues, but it is enjoyable overall. 
        This one will be split into 3 sections. One to explain gameplay as it takes aspects from standard Shin Megami Tensei combat 
        and Persona daily life, but subtracts aspects from both sides. The second and third sections will review 
        the good and bad aspects of the game respectively.
