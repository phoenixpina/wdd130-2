            <h3>Question: Is there more than one river to raft on?</h3>
            <p>Answer: We have 2 rivers on site that are separated. Both flow down the mountain, but one river
                is much smoother than the other, and is meant for families with younger children or those
                who are looking for a more relaxing trip down a river.</p>
            <h3>Question: Are we able to rent rafts and other supplies on site?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Everyone is able to rent rafts, either individual rafts or family sized rafts for an additional fee.
                Floatation jackets, oars, helmets, etc. are also available. Please refer to our pricing chart when
                booking a trip. However, everyone is also welcome to bring their own rafts and/or supplies.</p>
            <h3>Question: Are we able to purchase food on site?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Yes, near the entrance (where you would check in and pick up rental supplies) there is a 
                snack bar that sells items such as hamburgers, hot dogs, energy bars, and bottled water. If you do not 
                wish to wait in line, you can also order food online on our site up to a week in advance (before your arrival).
                You are welcome to bring your own food and water, but PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A FINE FOR LITTERING. We have 
                plenty of trash cans at the entrance, near the snack bar, and at the various campsites.</p>

            <h3>Question: Is white water rafting safe?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Just as with any physical activity, there are risks associated with participating in white water
                rafting. Please refer to the above image. The above group are on the rigorous river, and can be seen putting
                a lot of effort into rafting. However, you can also see that they are wearing helmets and floatation jackets 
                to protect them. Also, you can see that they are having fun. White water rafting is fun! But if you are 
                understandably worried for the safety of yourself and others you will be rafting with, we invite you to
                raft down our easy river. Also, we have many park rangers patrolling the rivers to assist with the safety 
                of everyone.</p>
